# Data Visualization
In the frame of Udacity Nanodegree, I wanted to visualize dataset to get insights. My variables were "country","Gender" and perceived control variables.

I began with data exploration and transformation,

Univariate exploration of all my variables
Bivariate exploration (Gender VS Math, Reading and Science Scores, Country VS Math, Reading and Sciences Scores, Perceived Control VS the 3 scores). To understand Country Scores, I've tried to check the association between Country and Perceived Control, but the comparison was a little difficult.
Multivariate exploration (Gender VS Score VS Perceived Control, Country VS Score VS Perceived Control).
My conclusions are as following:

There are differences in scores between Countries: China, Hong Kong, Singapour, and Japan are on the top of Math, Reading, and Science scores. At the bottom, we find Peru, Indonesia, Qatar, and Brazil.
There isn't any difference between male and female
The impact of perceived control is minimal
If we take a multivariate comparison Country VS Gender VS Scores, there isn't any gender difference due to the top or bottom countries. So it mightn't be economic inequalities.
I've made another data visualizations to change the chosen countries (top and bottom)
